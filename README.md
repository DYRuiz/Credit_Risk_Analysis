# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

This analysis is to compare the effectiveness of various supervised machine learning models in determining credit risk.  The data used is a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.  The models used for sampling were:
- Native Random Oversampling
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Cluster Centroid Sampling
- SMOTEEN samping
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
